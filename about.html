            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I‚Äôm Kai üëã ‚Äî a data scientist who wants to make a real, tangible impact. I believe action beats
                perfection: experimenting, iterating and learning by doing are at the core of how I operate and approach
                problems.

                I dive into messy datasets, uncover hidden patterns and build solutions that actually move things
                forward. Beyond the numbers, I‚Äôm fueled by curiosity, creativity and the drive to turn ideas into
                reality.

                When I‚Äôm not coding or analyzing data, you‚Äôll probably find me hiking through nature, cooking up
                something new in the kitchen, playing sports or enjoying a great glass of wine from vineyards based in
                my home region, Pfalz.
            </p>

                    <p>
                        At the moment, I‚Äôm completing my Master‚Äôs in Data Science at the University of Mannheim, with an
                        exciting exchange semester at the University of Adelaide.
                        During this Master‚Äôs I got the chance to be part of multiple hands-on projects in domains such
                        as Computer Vision, XAI and Time Series Forecasting.
                        <!-- <ul>

                            blending cutting-edge ML with transparency and trustworthiness</li>
                        <li>Master‚Äôs thesis on time series forecasting with deep learning and transformers, exploring
                            how to predict future trends from complex data</li>

                        <!-- My professional journey spans full and part time work at ICIS and Fraunhofer SIT, blending
                        technical innovation with meaningful
                        real-world impact.  -->
                        At <strong>ICIS</strong>, I've built real-time price classification models
                        that improved electricity
                        price forecasts by 5%.
                        At <strong>SIT</strong>, I was part of the MaLeFiz project and developed fraud detection systems
                        for monetary transactions using
                        graph-based ML and showcased our work via an interactive demo website.

                        But I don‚Äôt stop there: I‚Äôve also worked on reseach projects in financial fraud detection,
